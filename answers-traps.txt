a0 a1 a2, the register a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf

li a1, 12 represent the function call has been finished and get the result of f function

1536(ra) = ra + 1536 = pc + 1536 = 097 + 1536 = 15ed

after the jalr to printf in main, ra register load the next register addr, so it is the 600080e7 + 4 = 600080eb

the output is HE110 World
in big-endian machine, we can set i to be 0x00726c64 to get the same result
and 57616 can be changed as 61675(?)

y=8229
y=1 (if keep the above statement)
depend on the context(?)
